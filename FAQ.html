      <div class="QA">
        <p class="question"><strong>What are your hours?</strong></p>
        <p class="answer">Booking time is available Monday - Sunday from <strong>7pm - 7am</strong> on a first book first serve basis.</p>
        <p class="question"><strong>What are the rates?</strong></p>
        <p class="answer"><strong>30/HR</strong> or <strong>$200/Night</strong> (12 hours)</p>
        <p class="question"><strong>Can I record my band?</strong></p>
        <p class="answer">Unfortunately being a smaller space we do not support full band tracking capabilities. The space does however support 1-2 guitar players comfortably.</p>
        <p class="question"><strong>How many people will fit in the room?</strong></p>
        <p class="answer">The room currently supports 4 people, with additional spill over lounge space outside of the room.</p>
        <p class="question"><strong>Are you a social studio?</strong></p>
        <p class="answer">We are <strong>not</strong> a social studio. The room is for artists whose true goal is to work. We do not allow large groups during sessions and encourage our members to only book sessions with artists who share a similar goal of making music. Members are responsible for all of their guests and will be held accountable for any of their guests actions.</p>
        <p class="question"><strong>How do I book a session?</strong></p>
        <p class="answer">We are a members based studio. All members must fill out an online application and have an in-person meeting with a studio manager. We are seeking artists with strong work ethics who look to genuinely unlock the potential of the space. Due to limited slots membership is not guaranteed. Members will have the ability to create a custom weekly schedule or book the weekly available times listed every Sunday night on our site.</p>
        <p class="question"><strong>What if I need to cancel?</strong></p>
        <p class="answer">Any cancellations after 12 hours before session will result in a $50 cancellation fee. Any sessions booked day of that cancel will also result in a $50 cancellation fee.</p>
